People may misuse the term when they want to label others who have hurt them or displayed arrogant behavior, without considering whether those individuals genuinely meet the criteria for a diagnosis of Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD).

      "\n",
      "1. Running Python code with command line arguments can be done using the terminal (built-in or external) by providing the script name and any desired input values when executing the Python interpreter. You may also want to check out built-in tools like `argparse` for handling command line arguments in your scripts.\n",
      "2. If you're looking for an alternative IDE, Visual Studio Community (VS Community) is a version of VSCode that has additional features and integrations with Microsoft products. However, if you don't need those extra functionalities or prefer the simplicity of other tools like Atom or Sublime Text, it may not be worth the switch.\n",
      "3. Regarding your issue with copying text in RTF format, make sure that you are using an extension specifically designed to handle this type of formatting for pasting into third-party applications such as MindJet. You might also try comparing the differences between the generated code when copying from VSCode vs Atom or Sublime Text and see if there's any discrepancy that needs fixing in your extension settings.\n",
      "4. For website design feedback, it sounds like you have some constructive input regarding usability issues such as blurring elements not seeming clickable due to game UI conventions and missing features like a link back to the homepage or better alignment/centering of page sections. Feel free to share this feedback with your designer for consideration in future iterations!\n",
